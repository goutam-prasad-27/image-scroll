## AI Image Showcase

This is a simple HTML and CSS project that displays a grid of images. 

### Functionality

* Displays a heading "AI Image Showcase".
* Showcases up to 20 images in a grid layout.
* Each image has a border and rounded corners.
* Images are displayed with an appearing animation.

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the repository:**  
  If you forked this repository, clone it to your local machine using Git. 
2. **Add your images:**  
  Replace the placeholder image names (`img-1.jpeg` to `img-20.jpeg`) in the HTML file with your desired image filenames. Make sure your images are placed in a folder named "images" within the project directory.
3. **Run the code:**  
  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the image showcase.

### Customization

* You can modify the CSS file (`style.css`) to change the overall styling of the page, including colors, font sizes, and image dimensions.
* You can adjust the number of images displayed by adding or removing image blocks in the HTML file.
* Feel free to experiment with the animation properties in the `appear` keyframe animation to create different visual effects.
